		<P> Don't let people bring you down  cause they too feel drowned and stuck to the abyss of despair. Instead, focus on your goals and dreams that will make a greater impact to humanity because every live matters (and I truely mean it). Therefore, let me motivate you with three explanations to keep everyone to have doubts in life.

                	<p> Before one can change the world, one must understand that they can't change the world by themselves. It requires a team excercise and building connection in order to strenghten the pyramid. I know that there are people that find making friends is not their speacialty, but it's not the matter of making friends rather making connections like a road. Be sure to learn how to make good conversation and that alone can help you sharpen your interaction skills. Just be aware that some people perfer to be left alone at some time. It's only necessary to make ineractions to people that are sure to benefit you in life (Remember that causality  has the effects on every single individual so use it to your advantage by finding the good path and not the demise one).

                <p>Being a builder doesn't mean building large human monuments that will stand for thousands of decades. It doesn't require to be natural at building creative sculptures, but rather being able to layout a trail of dreams. There is a path for every person and each path has many possibilites of outcomes that one can't comprehend. I, for one, have many blueprints that layout my dreams: some are apprehanded and others are dismissed. Don't settle for one path, make multiple paths as it is normal to abandon a sunken ship in order to live. Don't be afraid to reset your whole pathway as failure to do so can lead to a unfortunate demise. I can promise you that the hardest thing to do in life is to make a map and follow the trails; on the other hand, other tasks can be simply accomplish through will-power. To make things short, be a great builder to make great plans for the future of you and the mankind.

					<p>Notice the chart above this divs says "predicted categories." We could all assume that these estimate data is fake and only try to make some people feel vunerable. However, if we actually take account to the chart, do you see every people being happy for their entire day( quick anwser: <b><big>NO</big></b>)? Everyone has their ups and downs: maybe it's because of their friend's new friend that makes you jealous, maybe it's because of the smart kid in your class is going to Harvard and not you, maybe it's because of the time you got flatout rejected by the most popular girl and the whole school hears about it. Stuff like these can led to depression and in some sad cases, suicide. Don't let one thing make the decision of your existence. To erase such burdens, one must achieve a great goal that can outshine our past mistakes and drama. Be aware that every single human being on this planet holds value to the idea of causality. Don't play as the hero if you're certain that you are going to regret. Instead, focus on things that you can achieve as small steps can led to enormaous achievements. Trust me, I have been there.

	<!--	<p>This is my first attempt to reach out towards other people. I don't like to ask much, but if you can be genourous and donate for more upcoming projects, I would be happy and even more encourage to make even more projects that can benefit the furthest person I can reach through online. I will still make projects regardless, but I too have struggles to worry about and can't complete my mission unless I ask for your charity.
